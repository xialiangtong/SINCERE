Juan Hernandez is a Shopify merchant that owns a Pepper sauce shop
with five locations: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary and Halifax.
He also sells online and ships his sauces across the country from one
of his brick-and-mortar locations.

The pepper sauces he sells are:

Jalapeño (J)
Habanero (H)
Serrano (S)
The inventory count for each location looks like this:

City	J	H	S
Toronto	5	0	0
Vancouver	10	2	6
Montreal	3	5	5
Calgary	1	18	2
Halifax	28	2	12
Every time he gets an online order, he needs to figure out
which locations can fulfill that order. Write a function that
takes an order as input and outputs a list of locations which
have all the items in stock.

Example
Input : J:3. H:2 s:4
Output: Van, Mon, Hali

Input: H:7 S:1
